For Project 3, team CryVesto 3.0 seeks to address funding through the blockchain and smartcontracts for a multi-media company "Light-Camera-Action"(LCA) to produce movies; games; NFTs; education material in the multi-verse and AR & VR platforms for theme centered fan entertainment. Our goal is to offer investment opportunities to financiers and a gateway to retail fans globally using smart contracts on the blockchain to defragmentize the global entertainment industry. 

Our approach to the global entertainment marketplace is to provide opportunities for retail investors and fans to participate through investing in their favorite entertainment themes globally. The primary funding of LCA is from CryVesto PE with High-Net-Worth individuals through securitized smart contracts on the blockchain and retail investors for secondary round of funding for their preferred entertainment projects. In this way, we can raise funds globally for market participants where the entertainment production is produced. 

This can attract greater participation from regional participants by providing investment opportunities in their favorite project themes and receive future returns in the form of 'Bollycoins'. The ‘Bollycoin’ returns are profits and royalties from their favorite entertainment production. This allows greater interaction between the studios, entertainers and fans to benefit from the financial returns of each production and enjoy the LCA entertainment ecosystem.  

We believe that utilizing blockchain technology and smartcontracts in producing 'Bollycoin' tokens allows greater participation for the CryVesto PE firm to raise funds from a broader audience of HNW clients to interested fans at large globally. In this way we defragmentize the entertainment industry that is currently regionally isolated in its respective territorial markets to a more inclusive global intercultural entertainment company.
