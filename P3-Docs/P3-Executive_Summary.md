### Introduction________________________________________
 
CryVesto PE seeks an innovative approach to address funding using the blockchain and smartcontracts for multi-media company "Light-Camera-Action"(LCA) to produce movies; games; NFTs; education material in the multi-verse and AR & VR platforms for theme centered fan entertainment. Our goal is to offer investment opportunities to financiers and provide a gateway to retail fans internationally using smartcontracts on the blockchain to defragmentize the global entertainment industry.

### Company’s Role and Strength________________________________________

Utilizing our expertise in Fintech and an innovative approach to broaden opportunities for retail investors brings prospective fans in closer proximity to passionately support their favorite artists and entertainment themes. This provides greater allowance for a larger group of investors who ordinarily wouldn’t be able to participate in financing films, music, games and other forms of entertainment projects. Our strength is creating global opportunities for fans who want to support their favorite artists and entertainment themes, but get a return on their money spent by investing to complement their amusement. 

### Need/Problem________________________________________

The growing entertainment activity on the internet, with the increasing interest in cryptocurrency and NFTs we seek to address a way to utilize new FinTech technologies to support a wider market of investors. By attaching tangible IP assets with production projects, we can bring quantifiable returns to both fungible tokens (FTs) and non-fungible tokens(NFTs) in the LCA environment.   

### Unique Solution________________________________________
 
Our approach to the global entertainment market is to provide opportunities for retail investors and fans to participate through investing in their favorite entertainment themes. The primary funding of LCA is from CryVesto PE with High-Net-Worth individuals through securitized smartcontracts on the blockchain and retail investors for secondary round of funding for their preferred entertainment projects. In this way, we can raise funds internationally for market participants where the entertainment production is produced.


### Resources________________________________________
 
Cryvesto PE is seeking to raise seed money capital for ‘Lights Camera Action Multi-Media LLC’ to lease/purchase real estate property for studios and offices; film production equipment, computer hardware & software; employees for film production, employees for metaverse technology development; AR/VR technicians for gaming and education development.

### Return on Investment________________________________________
 
Attracting a larger group of investors from both HNW individuals and passionate retail fans, we believe that increasing the number of investing participants can provide the seed money for projects that regional markets are willing to support. With regional retail investment support chances are greater a project meets and attracts the desires of market consumers to spend money on their favorite entertainment.  Understanding that we see increased revenue streams and thus greater ROI.  
The ROI will be realized for investors through “BollyCoin” token dividends, NFT royalties and transactions within the LCA economic environment by fans for their favorite entertainment and/or memorabilia items for amusement and trade.   

### Competition________________________________________

Currently we do not see any competition utilizing FinTech in this matter to finance an entertainment company, while providing investment opportunities to fans. 

### Marketing Strategy________________________________________

Marketing an investment opportunity regionally to prospects to finance their fan favorites and get a quantifiable return from various entertainment theme projects can provide a chance for them previously not available.  This can attract greater participation from regional fans by providing them opportunities in their favorite project themes and receive future returns in the form of 'Bollycoins'. The ‘Bollycoin’ returns are profits and royalties from their favorite entertainment production. This allows greater interaction between the studios, entertainers and fans to benefit from the financial returns of each production and enjoy the LCA entertainment ecosystem.

### Budget________________________________________
 
Budgets and expenses will be commensurate with the regions and local markets in which a project is produced. As such, there is proportionate expense within the economic markets in which a project is produced. Intrinsically, budgets can be affordable employing local creators, artists, technicians and labor.   

### Conclusion________________________________________

We believe that utilizing blockchain technology and smartcontracts to facilitate investment in entertainment projects, 'Bollycoin' tokens allow fan participation for the CryVesto PE firm to raise funds from a broader audience of HNW clients to interested fans at large globally. In this way, we’re migrating the entertainment industry that is currently regionally isolated in its respective territorial markets to a more inclusive global intercultural entertainment company.  By including and addressing the needs of diverse cultures in entertainment, LCA also diversifies its portfolio revenue streams for greater chances of success and profits.  


We believe that utilizing blockchain technology and smartcontracts to facilitate investment in entertainment projects, 'Bollycoin' tokens allow fan participation to raise funds in addition to HNW clients.  

Retail investors will invest in their favorite entertainment projects and receive Bollycoins and/or  NFTs. The BollyCoins can receive dividends and the NFTs can produce royalty returns on assets. In this way, we can raise funds internationally from fans and market participants where the entertainment production is produced
